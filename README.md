A program to automate subway suffers and temple run

Build Status Python PEP8 Gitmoji

🚀 Brief Idea
Dive into a new era of gaming with my groundbreaking project that combines cutting-edge technology, MediaPipe, and Pose Detection to automate endless running games. 🤖💃

In today's dynamic gaming landscape, it's not just about playing; it's about redefining how we interact with our favorite titles. 🚀🕹️ This project comes as a response to the evolving expectations of gamers worldwide.

Imagine the thrill of controlling popular endless running games like Subway Surfer and Temple Run with your very own movements! 🏃‍♂️💨 The integration of Pose Detection technology opens up a realm of possibilities, providing a seamless and immersive gaming experience that goes beyond traditional controls.

In my detailed video demo, I guide you through the step-by-step process of implementing this innovation. 📽️🔧 Be among the first to witness the magic unfold and discover how you can elevate your gaming experience to new heights.

🌐 Application in the Real World: This project is not just a technological showcase; it's a practical application that brings a touch of the future into our daily gaming adventures. The excitement lies in the realization that what was once science fiction is now a tangible and exhilarating reality.

✨Tech Stack
Scripting Language: Python
OpenCV (cv2): Open Source Computer Vision Library is used for real-time computer vision tasks such as image and video manipulation, object detection, and pose estimation.
Mediapipe: A framework developed by Google for building machine learning pipelines to process media (such as images and video). In this script, it's specifically used for pose estimation.
PyAutoGUI: This library enables Python control of the mouse and keyboard for automation tasks. It's being used here to simulate key presses based on the detected pose.
NumPy: This library is used for numerical computing. It's commonly used for handling arrays and matrices, which are utilized for image processing tasks in this script.
Streamlit:: An open-source Python library for creating interactive web applications for machine learning and data science projects.
